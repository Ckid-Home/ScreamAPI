# ScreamAPI
#### A Legit DLC Unlocker for Epic Games
Welcome to the ScreamAPI repository.

### What is ScreamAPI?
ScreamAPI is a DLC unlocker for the games that are legitimately owned in your Epic Games account.
It attempts to fool the game that uses Epic Online Services Software Development Kit (EOSSDK)
into thinking that you own the desired DLCs. However, ScreamAPI does not modify the rest of the EOSSDK,
hence features like multiplayer, achievements, etc. remain fully functional.

### How do I install it?
There are couple of simple steps required to install and use the ScreamAPI.
1. Download the latest DLL from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/acidicoala/ScreamAPI/releases/latest).
2. 


### For developers

EOS SDK headers verions: 1.7.0

To get latest EOS headers, visit Epic Dev Portal at https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/ and download SDK.

### Acknowledgements
ScreamAPI would not be possible without [nEOS](https://gitlab.com/infogram/neos) by **infogram**.

It served as a great educational resource of how EOS SDK works.
This project borrows many ideas and implementations from nEOS,
so I extend my gratitude to infogram for making his EOS emulator publicly available.
